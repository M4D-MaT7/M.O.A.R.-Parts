Parts/Description/KV1_Onion,Text,,"After a very teary collective cooking session, the engineering team at Probodobodyne came up with the idea for the pod’s layered heat-shield structure. Almost as if it were an emotional metaphor, the design features a sphere-shaped capsule, detachable from the service module, covered in multiple layers of ablative material that allow it to survive re-entry while keeping the Kerbonaut inside safe and sound."
