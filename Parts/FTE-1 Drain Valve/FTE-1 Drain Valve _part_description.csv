Parts/Description/FTE1_Drain_Valve,Text,,"To solve the original FTX-1 fuel line issue, a FLOOYD engineer had a wild idea: what if you failed to attach a fuel pipe at all? Solves the issue of making sure the fuel goes in the right direction, because it just goes out. He was immediately demoted to bookkeeping, but FLOOYD later revived the concept as the FTE-1: a valve that lets you dump most resources from its attached part. Perfect for emergencies, flotation tweaks, or the occasional rocket prank."
