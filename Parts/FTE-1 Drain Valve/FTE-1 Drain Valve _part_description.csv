Parts/Description/FTE1_Drain_Valve,Text,,"While trying to solve the initial issue with the FTX-1 series fuel line, an engineer at FLOOYD Dynamics had an ingenious thought - what if you failed to attach a fuel pipe at all? Solves the issue of making sure the fuel goes in the right direction, because it just goes out. He was demoted and assigned to bookkeeping duties, but later on, FLOOYD resurrected his idea in the form of the FTE-1 - a valve that will allow you to drain most resources from the part that it happens to be attached to, great for emergencies, floatation adjustment, or just fun rocket pranks."
