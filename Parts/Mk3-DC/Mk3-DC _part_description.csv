Parts/Description/Mk3_DC,Text,,"The Mk3-DC is a heavy autonomous remote guidance drone core, developed after the Probodyne R&D team felt rival manufacturers' probe cores lacked ambition of scope and scale. The core is fully capable of piloting even the biggest of vessels with ease, and even comes with a revolutionary approach to preventing the unit from going rogue. In the event of an emergency, the drone core comes with a crew access hatch and a pair of complementary wire snips."
